# Hardware-Design

Full Adder: The goal of this experiment was to become familiar with the simulation and analysis tools that Vivado offers to circuit designers.  In this lab, we implement a simple full adder circuit in Verilog and then perform RTL analysis, I/O planning, simulations, synthesis, implementation, and finally test the output on the FPGA.  Through these tests, we are able to see the operational aspects of the design, as well as its feasibility.  It was found that the simulations and implementations in Vivado were consistent with the actual outputs on the FPGA, and that the design of the circuit was very efficient, ultimately using up less than %3 of the FPGA's resources.
